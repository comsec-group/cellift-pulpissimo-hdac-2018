# List of IPs and relative branch/commit-hash/tag.
# Uses the YAML syntax.
#
# Examples:
#
#   or10n:
#     commit: tags/PULP3_final
#     domain: [cluster]
#   udma:
#     commit: 62b10440
#     domain: [soc]
#   axi_slice:
#     commit: master
#     domain: [soc,cluster]
# If a *tag* or *commit* is referenced, the IP will be in a
#  state of DETACHED HEAD. Before committing any additional
#  work, make sure to checkout a branch.
